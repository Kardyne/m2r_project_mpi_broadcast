# Universit√© Grenoble Alpes parallel systems course project

This is a student project whose only aim is to better understand the MPI
algorithms.

This project aims to study different MPI_allreduce algorithms.
The first part consists in an analysis of the algorithm for
various network topologies, followed by an implementation and a testing
part which will be used to confirm or disprove the analysis.
Any discrepancy found will be investigated to find its source and
explain the differences encountered.
